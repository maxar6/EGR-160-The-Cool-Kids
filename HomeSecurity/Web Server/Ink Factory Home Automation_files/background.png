hi,

this is my index.html. it has a array of buttons that send out serials to a 
piaxe cpu and then a 433mhx transmitter.

some of the code has been copyied from the web somewhere and ive modified 
it a little. also sometimes the buttons dont display correctly on a andriod 
tab / phones, havnt manage to figure this out yet.

hope its of some help

stu
